- standardize all slide titles?
        - either make them all descriptive of the individual slide's content or make them all broken in section headers, not a mix of the two as we have right now
- change 'sf' to 'SF' in all var names?
        - to disambiguate from 'sf' the package
- decide whether to leave 'Geospatial_Data_in_R_prep.docx' document, or incorporate into participant_instructions.md
