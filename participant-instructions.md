# Participant instructions

Please install the following R packages, using `install.package('<pkg_name>') in R, prior to the start date:

* ggplot2
* ggmap
* sf
* tmap
* raster

If you are prompted by the question, "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", type "no" in your console and press Enter.

If you have trouble installing `ggmap`, try installing directly from Github, using
`devtools::install_github("dkahle.ggmap")`. Install `devtools` first, if necessary.

Then, open the [Part_1.html slides](https://dlab-geo.github.io/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-R-with-sf/docs/Part_1.html#1) file in the 'docs' folder to get started.

Contact us with any questions!
