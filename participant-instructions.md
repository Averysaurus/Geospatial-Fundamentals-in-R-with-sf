# Participant instructions

1. Please install the following R packages, using `install.package('<pkg_name>') in R, prior to the start date:
  * `ggplot2`
  * `ggmap`
  * `sf`
  * `tmap`
  * `raster`

  If you are __prompted by the question__, "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", type "no" in your console and press Enter.

  If you have __trouble installing `ggmap`__, try installing directly from Github, using
`devtools::install_github("dkahle.ggmap")`. Install `devtools` first, if necessary.

2. After installation is complete, open the [Part_1.html slides](https://dlab-geo.github.io/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-R-with-sf/docs/Part_1.html#1) file in the 'docs' folder to get started.
