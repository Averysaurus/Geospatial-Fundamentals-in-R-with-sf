- should we just move intro of tmap to notebook 04, day 2 (since that's where we start using thematic mapping anyhow)?

# 06
- translate the exercises


# 07
- drop moe cols
- translate exercises
- fix the merges so that they don't break hist(tracts_acs_sf_ac$med_hhinc) (because tracts appear to be missing medhhinc!)
- fix the API/medhhinc scatter plot (tied to same problem as prev)
- translate exercises
